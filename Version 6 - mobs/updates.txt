- Set caption to be frame-rate to monitor performance
- Set a wall image for now to make it look nice
- Created a mob class
    - Gave it an image and made it so that whenever there is an 'M' in the map, a mob will spawn there
- Added rotation to the mob so that it points at the player all the time
- Added movement to the mobs using equation of motion s = ut + 1/2â€‹at^2 which calcualtes the displacement with positive acceleration and adds it
    to the mob's position since I am using vectors. This is basically implementaion of physics
