- Created a new map using program called tiled. (In the game_folder)
- Created a new class for it called TileMap, i left the old one in case i needed it again
    - Used pytmx module to load the tmx file and blit it onto the screen
    - Made it flexible so that any size of map can be used

- Gave player and mobs a temp spawn position because map does not have spawn position
- (will take out after) made it so that the player gains health after killing a mob
