- Added collisions with the new map system
    - used an object layer on the map and renamed some to "Wall" to show where all the collisions need to be
      and added player and mon locations on the map too 

- Created new class called "Obstacle" that does not require image for all the collisions
- Added a debug mode so when I press the "H" key it will draw a cyan rectangle around all the sprite and object's hitboxes
