- Fixed a bug regarding player spawn position (took some time)
    - When we added a wall to the top corner of the map, it affected the player spawn position
      This is because the in the __init__ of the player sprite, the player rect was at (0, 0) which then
      messed with the collisions. This problem was also with the mobs.

- Made it so that the mobs try to avoid each other but stil chase the player which makes them not clump up
- Mobs now move if they are within a certain radius of the player
    - can be adjusted in the settings
    - takes the distance between the player and the mob and if it's smaller than the radius then it will update 
      its movement
- Mobs also chase the player if other mobs in a "AWARENESS_RADIUS" are chasing the player too
- Created a list of different speeds that are randomly assigned to the mobs
