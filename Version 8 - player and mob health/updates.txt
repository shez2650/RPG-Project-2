- Added health to the mobs
- Bullet has a damage setting
- Health bar shows up when under 100%
- Gave player health so that the game can end
- Player has health bar that is always visable
- Made mobs do damage when collide with player and at a certain rate
- Player gets pushed back when the mob collides
    - walls did not collide with player since player was not moving so I updated the function to use rect distance of the player and the walls instead
- When the player's health is less than or equal to 0, then the game resets
