- Added a smoke/ flash effect when the player shoots a bullet
    In the settings file, all the image directories are loaded into a list
    Then in the main game, the images are loaded also into a list
    I created a MuzzleFlash class, which may be used as a vfx class later, which selects a random size
      and scales the image to that size, then assignes the rect to the position given. In the update function,
      it checks if the sprite has exceeded its lifespan and if it has it kills it.
    Also, the MuzzleFlash only displays if there is no other MuzzleFlash currently in use
      I did this by checking if there is any instances of the MuzzleFlash class in the all_sprites group of the
      game and if there isn't it will create one at the gun 

- Changed the all_sprites group to a LayeredUpdates group and assigned the sprites with a layer
  This allows me to controll what draws ontop of/ under what
  The MuzzleFlashes will always be drawn over the player

- Made the zombie movement even better
  When zombie awareness is being used, it will not follow the player but the zombie instead
  Made it so that if the zombie is shot, it will chase the player so the player can't just sit back and snipe. This will make other zombies follow it aswell

- Shows player's coordinates when in debug mode
